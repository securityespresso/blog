The Security Espresso community is now **accepting submissions for talks**.
There is **no deadline**. You can submit your **ideas** anytime!

Security Espresso talks are aimed at **developers**. The format may assume that the audience is familiar with common programming languages and practices. A talk can discuss any type of security process or security vulnerability, as long as it also provides **solutions** and possible ways to secure against the attacks or exploits it describes. Talks can also attempt to break down and **explain** a certain feature that is meant to make applications more secure, and how it can be implemented.

## Submission format

Please include the following information in your idea submission:
* Title
* Type of submission: presentation or workshop (must include a live demonstration)
* A brief description of **why this topic is relevant for developers**
* Describe the security concern (attacks / exploit / vulnerability), if applicable
* Describe the security feature / pattern / protocol, if applicable
* Solutions or take-aways for programmers which will conclude the talk

## What you can expect as a Security Espresso speaker

* 45 minutes of presentation time
* an engaged, technical audience
* networking after your talk, as well as at the end of the meetup
