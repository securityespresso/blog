## Font Options

This theme comes with two font options; a serif and sans-serif (the default). 
Switching between them is done in the HTML, by adding `serif` to the `class` of 
the `<body>` element in [head.html](https://github.com/vormwald/joon/blob/master/_layouts/default.html.hbs#L6).

## Colour Options

This theme uses an accent colour for links and the border at the top of pages.

To change this colour, you need to edit [assets/css/screen.css](https://github.com/vormwald/joon/blob/master/assets/css/screen.css).

There are only two values you need to change, conveniently **located at the very
top of the file**.
